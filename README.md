Dav makes a Hello World repository!

Hi GitHub-ers! (What are we called here? Gits? Hehe)
I'm Dav, an IT student majoring in App Dev.
New to Git but not new to the tech world!
Currently working in Script on an iOS game, and committed to #100DaysofCode with FreeCodeCamp.org
You can find me there/anywhere that code exists as jessdavcode!

My current goal: relearn everything I've forgotten from FreeCodeCamp, and contribute to Habitica as a Blacksmith!
