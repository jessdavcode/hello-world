Dav makes a Hello World repository!<br />

Hi GitHub-ers! (What are we called here? Gits? Hehe)<br />
I'm Dav, an IT student majoring in App Dev.<br />
New to Git but not new to the tech world!<br />
Currently working in Script on an iOS game, and committed to #100DaysofCode with FreeCodeCamp.org<br />
You can find me there/anywhere that code exists as jessdavcode!<br />

My current goal: relearn everything I've forgotten from FreeCodeCamp, and contribute to Habitica as a Blacksmith!
